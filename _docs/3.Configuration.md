After you've published the config file `config/spam-blocker.php`, you can customize the settings :


```php
<?php

return [
    // The blacklisted spammers source file.
    'source'  => base_path('vendor/piwik/referrer-spam-blacklist/spammers.txt'),

    // Include new hosts to the blacklist.
    'include' => [
        //
    ],

    // Exclude hosts from the blacklist.
    'exclude' => [
        //
    ],
];
```
